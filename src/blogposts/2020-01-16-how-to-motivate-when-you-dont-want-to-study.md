The thing which can motivate you most are your dreams. Think about your dreams and goals. Think about your parents. Think about a good future ahead.
  
 You will need to replenish your low motivation levels to start. Innovative study methods and keeping things interesting is the way to keep going.
 
 Watch some motivation videos before you start studying. Do not get diverted to other recommended videos. Use the motivation received from the video to start with high energy. Get in the flow of studying. Once you enter the focused study mode, your study sessions will get longer.
  
  Starting your study session is tough. But keeping the motivation throughout is not easy either. Change the subjects in between to prevent getting bored.
  
**  
  Take short breaks in between your study session to refresh the brain. Eat snacks and relax during the break. **Do not immerse yourself in video games or television. Otherwise, it will elongate your break from minutes to hours. Let your mind rest. Praise yourself for the discipline you just showed. It will tempt you to show the discipline again.
  
  Sometimes the reason for not feeling like studying is the perceived difficulty. If the subject is too difficult, students try to avoid studying. Get friends to study with you in such cases.
  
**  Group study work well for some students. You might want to give it a try and get the help of your friends in understanding tough topics.** Just ensure that all the friends participating are in a mood to study as well. Or else your study session will turn into fun get together.


*Motivation is generally very short term. It fades away in time if it does not have a solid vision associated with it. You will not get the same adrenaline rush every day after watching a motivational video.*

*The video method is ineffective. Just like every other external motivation source. The key is to develop a system or routine that runs with a sense of responsibility and dedication.*

**The routine** feeds on your objectives, visions, and daily habits. Once you develop a routine, you will not rely on the dose of daily motivation. Involve these habits in your routine.

#### Go on walks or do some physical activities

**Walking is** an ecstatic experience when you are tense about deadlines, assignments, and chapter completions. Walking relaxes your brain and gets the creative juices flowing. You can also do other physical activities like hitting the gym and playing sports.

We are emphasizing walks because it is an equipment-free activity. It is a mild physical movement with minimal fatigue. It allows your brain to rest and think for a while. After physical activity, your focus and concentration increase for a long period.

####**Focus on one work at a time**

This is an important habit to inculcate in your lifestyle. As a student, you will have several works to handle in a day. Patiently write them down individually early morning. Basically, prepare a to-do list of things to study. Break your study syllabus into tasks. During the day, pick one task at a time. Decide which task you will do at this moment. You will be focusing all your commitment to this work.

#### Clean up and prepare

Studying in a messed up area is a big no-no. You will feel clumsy in such surroundings. Before you start studying clear space and remove any distraction. Keep only the things necessary to finish the task. When you are cleaning up the room for studying, you will feel a sense of commitment and responsibility towards the upcoming study session. You will naturally put higher efforts to gain more from the study session. Cleaning your study space is an important routine habit to adopt.
Just start

Once you have cleaned up your study area and sat on the study point with your supplies, do not hesitate about starting. Just get going with your assignment or your chapter. Start raw and unorganized. You need to remove any mental resistance or doubt.
