Most of the students are burning the midnight oil to cover every nook and cranny of their syllabus, so here are some helpful CBSE board exam study tips that may help you to effectively prepare for the CBSE Class 12 Mathematics exam:

#### 1. Understand the contents and weightage of the syllabus

Firstly, go through the latest CBSE Class 12th Maths syllabus 2020, where you will find the weightage of different units (as given below)

Relations and Functions - 8 Marks
Calculus- 35 Marks
Algebra- 10 Marks
Vectors and Three-Dimensional Geometry- 14 Marks
Linear Programming– 05
Probability - 08
Total Marks -80
Internal Assessment- 20

It is highly recommended that students preparing for CBSE Class 12 Maths Board Exam 2020 should first focus on (easy to prepare) units with maximum weightage in board exam, because it’ll help to boost your morale, and eventually lay a foundation for you to move on to more difficult topics.

#### 2. Preparation from NCERT textbooks is the most important part

Though supplementary books may be used as references, the NCERT textbooks offer an exhaustive range of exercise questions and solved examples on every topic, which is more than enough to do well in your board examinations.

Keep marking the important and difficult questions while doing so, and make sure to keep a reference book alongside your NCERT textbooks, for immediate clarification on complex topics.

#### 3. Strategize and THEN prepare!

The long form questions (5-6 marks), which are the most feared aspect of a paper, usually come from one of the following sections:

Calculus, which carries a whopping 44% weightage, and can be really scoring
Differential Equations consisting of the application based difficult questions.
Vectors and 3D geometry carry the next highest 17% weightage.

The aforementioned topics are practice-based and the best way to gain perfection in them is to practice and solve more and more problems on them. Then,

Probability, Relations and Functions and Algebra have a weightage of 10%, 10% and 13% respectively.
Linear Programming: 6%

These topics don’t require additional practice beyond the ones you have covered in your NCERT textbooks.

In linear programming, a 5-mark question comes from this chapter, which can be dealt with through little practice of understanding the questions and writing the linear equations.


#### 4. Practice sample papers and previous years’ papers

Examiners follow a pattern of repetition for specific important questions over a number of years, which is why it is very important to go through previous years’ papers.

Make sure that you solve the last few year’s papers on a timer, it will improve your speed, reasoning ability, and time management skills.

#### 5. Say goodbye to rote learning!

Mathematics is all about understanding the concepts. So mugging up is not going to be of much help on the day of the examination.

Try to understand the fundamentals of the formulas; usually, they are all based on a single conceptual framework, and once you understand that, you can automatically do away with the mugging up of endless formulas.

#### 6. Self-evaluation

As a step toward feeling less anxious, start by acknowledging your grey areas and your weaknesses.

Devote more time to improving them instead of making yourself feel bad about it. Maintaining a peaceful frame of mind is more significant than any preparation.

#### 7. Presentation is very important

Neat work is a non-negotiable perk that always benefits a student. Make sure to label the graphs and figures properly.

Avoid overwriting and scribbling, if you’ve made a mistake then strike it off and start from below. Always leave some space between two questions, and start a new section on a fresh page.

#### 8. Time management

The reading time is the most crucial and must be used judiciously. This involves reading the paper thoroughly, especially the ones involving statements, underlining keywords and then choosing the most scoring questions based on your understanding.

If you’re stuck on a question, leave some space and keep moving forward. You can revisit it later with a fresh mind.

Always keep 15-20 minutes buffer time for revising and rectifying your answers at the end.
