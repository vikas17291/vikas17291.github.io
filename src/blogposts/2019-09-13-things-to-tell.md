## Things to tell yourself when you don't want to study!



These are 12 things you can tell yourself when you feel a little demotivated and a little overwhelmed. 

- You are very lucky and privileged to have access to almost unlimited knowledge and you should appreciate that.
    
 - Be one of those rare people who step over their insecurities and succeed.
 
  -  “Everything you want is on the other side of fear” George Addair
  
   - You will know what to do as soon as you start. Ideas and motivation doesn’t just appear from inactivity.
   
   - Make yourself proud.
   
   - One hour every day doesn’t feel like much but it’s 365 hours a year.
   - It’s not supposed to be easy. Nothing good is easy.
   
  - If you had a child or younger sibling to look after, you’d make them study because you want them to accomplish something. Love yourself.
  - Let the process be your result. 
  
  - Maybe you think that you can never find something to use your skills, mindset and knowledge for. But if you continue to invest in what matters to you, it will find its way out there.
  
   - Wake up with determination, go to bed with satisfaction
   
   - You are good enough
