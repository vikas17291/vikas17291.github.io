Here we are discussing a few tips on how a students can maintain the right balance between JEE and CBSE board examinations. These are given below:

#### 1. Go Through the Syllabus for Examinations

Before drawing the preparation plans for last days before the exams, it is absolutely essential to analyse the syllabus for both CBSE and JEE Main Examinations. Board exams cover only 12th standard syllabus whereas JEE Main covers both 11th and 12th standard syllabus. While practicing for CBSE 12th Board Exams, it is possible that students miss the class 11th topics to be prepared for the JEE Main. So, checking the syllabus will remind you about the main content of the examination. After gaining the knowledge of your upcoming examination syllabus, the next step is to divide it accordingly for revision session.



#### 2. Focus on boards first; JEE comes second

Most of the students believe that because the syllabus of both these exams is the same, therefore, they should prepare for JEE more than CBSE. The truth is that most number of students who give more importance to JEE than CBSE, often do not score well in boards and also do not clear their first JEE attempt. This leaves them depressed and de-motivated for further studies. Remember, CBSE asks basic questions and by preparing well for CBSE, you will clarify your concepts in a brilliant way. This is, in a way, a first step to master JEE. JEE asks tougher questions, which can only be answered with the right strategy and if you have cleared the concepts. NCERT books should be focussed for CBSE and once this is done, you should move towards JEE.

#### 3. Focus on fundamentals and solve many numerical and problems

Because the syllabi of CBSE and JEE is similar, therefore, the students should use it as their advantage and not a burden. Prepare well for CBSE by focussing on the fundamentals and then solve a lot of questions and numerical. This will assist you in JEE exam preparation. Take the mock tests and assess your performance on not just the school-level, but the national level. Solve a lot of question papers.


#### 4. Divide your topics in three categories, viz. weak, not-so-strong and strong: Do it separately for CBSE and JEE

By preparing well for CBSE, you are actually just warming up for your JEE exams. All you need to have is a right strategy. First of all, write down the topics separately for CBSE and JEE. Keep them separated, even if they are similar. Now, in the list of CBSE topics, divide your topics on the three categories mentioned above. Do the same for JEE. Take BSE first and make sure that you “empty” the WEAK category first of all. Then move towards the not-so-strong category and eventually, practice a lot for the strong category. Repeat the same process for JEE as well.

#### 5. Keep yourself motivated, highly confident (but not over-confident) and take power breaks

So as to enhance your efficiency and strike a right balance between JEE and CBSE exam preparation, you have to keep confidence and make sure that you are super motivated towards your target. You have to hit the bull’s eye at any cost. Keep it in mind. Say to yourself every single day- “I can and I will.” Most importantly, have a proper time management for both the exam preparations and keep power breaks in between. During these power breaks, you can do anything to charge yourself up once again for efficiency. Take power naps of 30-35 minutes, take 20-30 minutes break from the studies and during this time, do not talk about studies at all. Take a walk, talk to your parents or friends and do whatever that de-stresses you.

The most important thing that you can do for balancing exam preparation between JEE and CBSE is timed mock test taking. Do not stress yourself and never take decisions or prepare an action plan in such situations. Remain patient and most of all, practice, practice and practice a lot.
