When a project calls for a database-driven CMS, I usually turn to [Craft](https://craftcms.com) these days. In Belgium, Craft is not a well known CMS (yet) and I find myself having to explain why I recommend it as a solution instead of other (more popular) products.

If you are a Craft developer, I am genuinely interested in what your sales pitch for Craft is. Here is the one I currently use.

## Working with the best of both worlds

1. Craft is based on battle-tested open source technologies (PHP, MySQL, Twig, Yii, Guzzle, Velocity, etc.). Whenever these technologies are updated, Craft benefits from the updates.
2. Craft is a paid product. In exchange for a small one time license fee, Pixel&amp;Tonic gives you technical support and access to all future updates of Craft.

## Support

If you have a problem, open source CMS developed by the community do not give you a unique, identified point of contact to help you. Most of the time, you are on your own.

With Craft, the support comes with your license. There is even a form in your control panel that you can use to contact support and send them a copy of your Craft log files and database to help them track the problem.

Craft support is so responsive, you sometimes wonder when these people sleep.

## Security

Of course no software is perfect, but Craft takes security [very seriously](http://craftcms.stackexchange.com/questions/4448/how-secure-is-craft-and-why-is-it-secure). Frequent [updates](http://buildwithcraft.com/updates) and [one-click updating](http://buildwithcraft.com/features/one-click-updating) make it easy to always have an up to date installation.

Some CMS need many third party add-ons to be fully functional. These add-ons can sometimes create security problems (no maintenance or updates, bugs in the code, etc.). Craft's extensive core feature set reduces the dependency on add-ons and third party solutions, which reduces risks.

## Multilingual by default

Craft's capabilities in terms of [localisation](https://buildwithcraft.com/features/localization) are second to none. That's very important in a country with three official languages. Multilingual websites are complex beasts and, if they are not integrated in the core, localisation features can rapidly become problematic.

Craft is developed on [Yii](http://www.yiiframework.com/), a PHP framework with an impeccable reputation in terms of internationalisation and localisation.

As of this writing, Craft's control panel is available in 18 different languages already.

## Powerful and flexible

Craft doesn't make any assumption about your content. It allows you to create as many content types as your project needs. Each content types has [custom fields](http://buildwithcraft.com/features/custom-fields), allowing you to build complex data structures. Craft also allows for easy management of the [relationships](http://buildwithcraft.com/features/relations) between various content types.

Coupled with the power of [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) as a templating language, the fact that entries, assets, users, categories and tags can all have custom data structures and can be related to one another makes Craft a tool that can help you wrangle any kind of website.

Speaking of modular data structures, the [Matrix field](http://buildwithcraft.com/features/matrix) alone deserves a mention. That field allows users to mix and match various block types to easily create tailor made entries without compromising on code quality.

## Extensibility

Craft has a modern, flexible and well documented set of APIs allowing developers to write custom add-ons and to integrate Craft with other systems and tools if your project requires it.

## UX / UI

It's when the site is delivered and in the hands of the client that a CMS really proves its worth. The attention [Pixel&amp;Tonic](http://pixelandtonic.com/) gives to user experience is visible in all aspects of the interface.

Functionalities like [Live Preview](http://buildwithcraft.com/features/live-preview) coupled with an intuitive and easy to use (responsive) control panel allow non technical users to easily manage even complex websites.

## Transparency

The price of your Craft license funds the development of the software. As long as they want money from us and from our clients, it is in Pixel&amp;Tonic's best interest to develop the platform and provide quality support.

That is a very straightforward and transparent model, which is not the case of the freemium model used by other CMSes on the market.

The [modular pricing model](https://buildwithcraft.com/pricing) Craft uses is very simple: you only pay for what you need. Even the 300$ of a full-blown pro license are a small amount of money when compared to the gains in terms of developement and maintenance time for me and my clients.
