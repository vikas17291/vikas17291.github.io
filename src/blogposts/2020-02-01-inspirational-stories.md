### Rajiv Dandotiya:

“Your marks in class 12 forms the foundation for your career and life”. This is a popular belief and what if we way that somebody totally shattered it into pieces?

Meet this person, who despite having passed the 12th std examinations with just 39%, managed to find a place in not just IIT, but also ended up getting a PhD from Lulea University in Sweden. Here’s presenting Rajiv Dandotiya, who was a government school student from a small town in Rajasthan. All it took for him to aspire an IIT seat was following a piece of suggestion to join IIT by a bookseller from whom he later purchased books to crack the JEE exams. After a few attempts, he had managed to win a seat for a dual degree program in Industrial Engineering & Management at IIT-Kharagpur. He is currently said to be working as an Assistant General Manager in a company called Maersk at Denmark.

### Abhishek Bhartiya

For Abhishek Bhartiya, the struggle is not just about the difficult chapters in his books. He helps his father–a cobbler–who earns between Rs 60-70 in his workshop, while his mother stitches rags to support their family.

Overcoming these financial hardships, Abhishek studied hard for the IIT entrance and made sure that his parents’ troubles didn’t go in vain.

Speaking to Silicon India, his father said, “We have just one small room where six of us live and that too, without electricity. So, he used to study under the lantern for five-six hours in the night… I am worried about the fees. From where can I manage the amount? This question is troubling my mind…”

But when Abhishek secured the 154th rank in the SC category of the 2015 IIT entrance test, the happiness of the Bhattacharya family knew no bounds. He secured admission at IIT-Kanpur.

### Shubham Chaurasia

Shubham Chaurasia’s academic excellence is as awe-inspiring as is the story of his struggles. While his father could not afford to educate him after class 10, a tuition class came to his aid and ensured that the hardworking student got what he deserved.

Speaking to The Better India, Shubham said, “My father is a betel seller, who struggled through many hardships to educate me. After I completed class 10, it became apparent that he wouldn’t be able to further fund my education. I had almost given up hope when I came across Magadh Super 30… The selected students stay at the Institute for two years, where they get proper guidance, free lodging, as well as food. Sometimes, older students come back here to help the current batch.”

### Naga Naresh Karutura

Naga Naresh Karutura was born in an underprivileged family in Andhra Pradesh. His father is a lorry driver and his mother is a homemaker.

In 1993, Naresh met with a terrible accident when he fell off a lorry and lost both his legs.

Not one to seek pity from the situation, he insists that his life did not change dramatically after the incident.

Even after the accident, he focused all his attention on his studies and cleared the IIT-JEE exam with an AIR of 992.

An optimist through and through, Naresh believes that the world is full of good people. One example he gives is of a man named Sundar, who after hearing Naresh’s story, came forward to pay his hostel fee.

He cracked the entrance exam with flying colours and maintained his excellence throughout the course at IIT Madras. Since he was passionate about computer science, algorithms, and game theory, when Google offered him a job, he took it with arms wide open.
